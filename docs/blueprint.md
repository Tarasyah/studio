- City Search: Allow users to search for weather conditions by city name.
- Hourly Forecast: Display a 4-segment forecast for each of morning, afternoon, evening and night.
- Tomorrow's Forecast: Display a weather forecast card for the next day, including temperature and weather conditions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Desaturated grayish-blue (#E0EBF5) to provide a calm, unobtrusive backdrop for the weather information, creating a clean and airy feel.
- Primary color: Light sky blue (#95D0FC) to evoke feelings of clear skies and pleasant weather, complementing the app's weather-focused content.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FDB373) to highlight key information and interactive elements, drawing the user's attention to important details.
- Font: Use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean, and readable UI. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Employ Lucide Icons for consistent, clear, and modern weather and UI icons.
- Use a main container with rounded corners, arranging the different dashboard widgets with a CSS grid or flexbox for a clean, responsive layout.
- The main dashboard should feature a left sidebar and a prominent search bar in the header.
- Subtle transitions and animations on data load or change, to enhance user experience.
